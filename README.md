# Survey Form Project

This is my survey form project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a user feedback form that collects various types of information through different form controls.

## Project Overview

The Survey Form project helped me learn how to create effective web forms that collect user input. By implementing various form elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns, I created a comprehensive form that demonstrates proper form structure and validation.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Creating accessible form layouts with proper labeling
- Implementing different input types (text, email, number, radio buttons, etc.)
- Adding form validation with required fields and min/max constraints
- Using fieldsets to group related form controls
- Implementing dropdown menus for selection options
- Adding textarea elements for longer text responses
- Creating a responsive form layout
- Using proper HTML form structure for data submission
- Adding placeholder text for better user guidance

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure containing the survey form and all its elements
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the form for better user experience

## Design Elements

The survey form features:
- A clear title and description
- Organized sections with fieldsets
- Required field validation
- Different types of input elements for various data types
- A clean, easy-to-follow layout
- Placeholder text to guide user input
- Radio buttons for single-choice questions
- Checkboxes for multiple-choice questions
- A textarea for open-ended feedback
- A clearly visible submit button

This project taught me the importance of well-designed forms in collecting user data. I learned that forms are a crucial part of web interaction and that proper validation and clear instructions help users provide the information you need efficiently.
